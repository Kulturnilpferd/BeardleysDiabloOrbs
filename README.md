# BeardleysDiabloOrbs
Beardley's Diablo Orbs addon for World of Warcraft (Legion)

Description:
This is my very own UI Version Diablo orbs in World of Warcraft Legion.
I have deleted the addon from Curse because that nasty suckers "join ther forces" with Twitch and I doesn't like the way they've
changed the page. After that they abandoned their nice programmed light weight addon updater for similar games and added this
to this fucking shitty spyie bloaty Twitch client with a worse portation.
Doesn't want to support these suckers so I deleted it.
Afterwards this was the beginning of my own "shitstorm" that is caused by stupid ceo descisions to lure more money out of whatever!
Why? Because then they released Battle for Azeroth... Well and burned the tree and so on. Due my study period I quit wow before
Battle of Shittyroth released and I am so proud that I never bougt that sneaky shitty World of Draenor story copy of a nightmare.
Well the game goes down down down and I am now playing Elder Scrolls Online. But I am very very sad compared to what I must leave...
Have written an open letter in their forums but was deleted with a one week ban period, thanks Shittzard! 
If there ever be a rescure for WoW and these shitty companies who ruined nice work I am back.
Prepare for a Beardley's Diablo Orbs for WoW Classic clients, It will be there but I never will publish this ever on Twitch or else
stupid Shithead companys!
